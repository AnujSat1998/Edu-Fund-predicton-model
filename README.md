# EduFund User Behavior Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior data from EduFund to predict the likelihood of users creating financial goals. The goal was to provide actionable insights that could help the platform enhance user engagement.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to:
- Analyze user data to understand behavioral patterns.
- Handle missing values effectively to ensure data integrity.
- Build a predictive model to forecast goal creation behavior.

## Approach
### Data Preprocessing
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset's structure.
- Handled **missing values** through imputation techniques to fill in gaps in the data.

### Model Building
- Engineered relevant features from user data (e.g., demographics, platform interactions).
- Implemented a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict goal creation behavior.

### Results
- The model achieved an accuracy of over 50%, offering useful insights into user engagement trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
